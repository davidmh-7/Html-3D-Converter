# Html-3D-Converter

This is a converter that makes anything on a web page in 3D using an Id. 

It is simple and practical, apart from that it is implemented so that the user can drag the object in a range of 360 degrees and make the object continue in the position that the user left it.







## Instructions

 - Download the project.
 - Once the project is downloaded, there is a folder with a JS. There is this converter,   copy and paste it into your project.
 - Once it is in your folder you would have to go to the component that you want to put in 3D and put the Id= "CrearEfecto3D".
 - Lastly you would have to put the <script src=""></script> and the path where your Js file is.
